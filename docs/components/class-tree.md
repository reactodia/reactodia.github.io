# Class Tree

[ClassTree](/docs/api/workspace/functions/ClassTree.md) is a component to display an [element type](/docs/api/workspace/type-aliases/ElementTypeIri.md) (class) tree for the workspace.

Element type graph is loaded from [data provider](/docs/concepts/data-provider.md) associated with the [diagram model](/docs/concepts/workspace-context.md).

In [graph authoring](/docs/concepts/graph-authoring.md) mode, the class tree can be used to create entity elements that are instances of the displayed types.

The same functionality is also available as `SearchSectionElementTypes` [unified search section](/docs/components/unified-search.md).
